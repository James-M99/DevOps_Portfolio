        <h3>WireGuard VPN</h3>
        <p>I have added a full tunnel VPN to the website through <button><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank">WireGuard</a>.</button>. After downloading the WireGuard app (for mobile) or software (for computer) a user can configure their WireGuard so that the website's IP address is used instead of their personal one.</p>
